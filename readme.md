# crabfish ü¶Ä‚ôüÔ∏è

Crabfish is a **chess engine** written from scratch, in rust. 
It can provide a **strong next move** for the current player, or an **evaluation of a board position**.

## Install
```bash
cargo install crabfish
```

## Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MonliH/crabfish.git
cd crabfish
cargo run --release
```

Note: the `--release` flag when building is **VERY IMPORTANT**.
The engine can not search very deep without the optimizations provided by it.

## Usage
You can either use the cli program, with the `move` subcommand, help:
```bash
./target/release/crabfish move --help
```

Or, if you want to use a chess gui supporting the UCI proticol, launch the engine with the `uci` argument in your gui:
```bash
./target/release/crabfish uci
```

## Techniques

* Negamax
* Alpha-Beta pruning
* Iterative deepening
* Principal Variation Search
* Null-move heuristic
* Reverse futility pruning
